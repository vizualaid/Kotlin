we always find something to measure in life
Each measurement requires an instrument and its own unit of measurement. 
For example, bodyweight is measured with scales in kilograms (or pounds),
time is measured with clocks in seconds, etc.
But how does one measure information in digital world?
  Bit: the smallest unit of information
      The information entered into the computer should be specific and unambiguous. 
      For a long time, people have used ciphers. The simplest and most convenient of them were digital.
      Any information can be presented in the form of numbers.
      When processed with a conventional computer, the data is encoded by numbers.
      They are represented by the electrical signals that the computer works with.

  For the convenience of distinguishing, signals of two levels are used in classical electronic computers.
  One of them corresponds to the number 1, and the other to 0.
  Any letter, sound, or image on a computer is represented by a set of numbers.
The numbers 1 and 0 are called binary.
  The smallest unit of information is the bit (b).Each digit of the machine binary code carries the amount of information equal to one bit.
Byte: a sequence of eight bits
      Since people do not consider the mass of ships in grams,
      larger and hence more convenient units were invented for measuring information as well.
    The processing of information takes place in the processor.
    This is a device that can work with several bits at once (8, 16, 32, 64, ...).
    The first computers processed 8 bits of information simultaneously,
    so we needed a new unit of measurement which was called a byte (B), which means 8 bits.
    ** bit = "b"
       bytes= "B"
       
Large units of information
    The computer industry has historically used the units kilobyte, megabyte,  and gigabyte 
    in at least two slightly different measurement systems,
    which are slightly contradictory to each other.
    1) one is a decimal-based system uses bytes in the power of ten  (S.I--> Internationak System)
    kilo = 10^3 bytes
    megabyte = 10^6 bytes
    gigabyte = 10^9 bytes
    2) power of 2 Binary-based system (This system was actively used to describe computer memory)
    kilo = 20^10 bytes
    megabyte = 20^20 bytes
    gigabyte = 20^30 bytes
    
  To resolve this confusion, the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) suggested 
  using prefixes kilo, mega, and giga only for the decimal-based system and
  to use new prefixes kibi, mebi, and gibi for the binary-based system.
  Here bi means binary: kibibyte is kilo binary byte.
    
    Measurement units conversion
    1 GiB = 1KiB * 1024 * 1024 = 1048576 KiB
    x bits to KiB==  (x/8) / 1024
     1 GB to kB
     1 GB = 1kB * 1000 * 1000 = 1000000 kB
