A variable is a storage for a value, which can be a string, a number, or something else.
Every variable has a name (or an identifier) to distinguish it from other variables.
I can access a value by the name of the variable.
Declaring
val for value kinda immutable variable
var for variable is mutable when we need for as many times
Both val and var keywords provide me a variable!
declaring and initializing at the same time
val num = 123 //int
val language = "Kotlin" //string
val ch= 'y' //char
var number = 10
number = 11 // ok
number = "twelve" // an error here! type conversion needed
