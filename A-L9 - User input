//Using readline() 
//To read a line of string in Kotlin, you can use readline() function.

fun main(arg: Array<String>){
    print("Enter the Number : ")
    var a=  readLine()!!.toInt()

    /*
    It's possible to take input as a string using readLine() 
    function, and convert it to values of other data type (like Int) explicitly. by .toInt ,.toLong ect.
     */
        println("The Number intered by user is $a ")
}

//Using Scanner Class
import java.util.Scanner

fun main(args: Array<String>) {

    // Creates an instance which takes input from standard input (keyboard)
    val reader = Scanner(System.`in`)
    print("Enter a number: ")

    // nextInt() reads the next integer from the keyboard
    var i:Int = reader.nextInt()

    println("You entered: $i")
/*
    Here, reader object of Scanner class is created.
    Then, the nextInt() method is called which takes integer input from the user which is stored in variable integer.
    To get Long, Float, double and Boolean input from the user,
    you can use nextLong(), nextFloat(), nextDouble() and nextBoolean() methods respectively.
