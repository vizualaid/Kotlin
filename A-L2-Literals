All programs essentially perform operations on strings, numbers and any other type of values.
--> These values are called Literals
Literals
--Integer
--character
--Strings

Interger numbers
//If an integer value contains a lot of digits, 
we can add underscores to divide the digits into blocks to make this number more readable:
for example, 1_000_000 is much easier to read than 1000000 eg. 1__000_000, 1_2_3.
**underscores canâ€™t appear at the start or at the end of the number.
**If you write _10 or 100_ , you get an error.
Characters
A single character can represent a digit, a letter, or another symbol 
'$', 'z', '0'
**incorrect: 'abc', '543'
for this we have Strings

Strings
double quotes instead of single ones. 
examples: "text", "I want to learn Kotlin", "123456", "e-mail@gmail.com"
