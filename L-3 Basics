Basic terminology
After you have seen the result, let's learn the basic terminology and then try to understand our program.

A program is a sequence of instructions (called statements), which are executed one after another in a predictable manner. Sequential flow is the most common and straightforward situation when statements are executed in the order they are written, i.e., from top to bottom, one after another;
A statement (or a programming statement) is a single command to be executed (like printing a text).
An expression is a piece of code that produces a single value (for example, 2*2 is an expression).
A block {...}; is a group of zero or more statements enclosed in a pair of curly braces.  
A keyword is a word that has a special meaning in the programming language. Names of keywords can't be changed.
An identifier (a name given by the programmer to identify a variable, class, function etc).

I did this program before 
fun main() {
    println("Hello World!")
}
Lets Disect this Hello World program.

fun main() { 
    // ...
}
The entry point. 
The keyword "fun" defines a function that contains a piece of code to execute. 
This function has a special name "main".It indicates the entry point of a Kotlin program. 
The function has a body enclosed in braces {...}.
The name of this function should always be the same: main. 
If you name it Main or MAIN or something else, the program will not start.

println 
This is one of the most important things to understand about the Hello World program.
We invoke the special function println to display a string followed by a new line on the screen.
We will often use this way to print something.
